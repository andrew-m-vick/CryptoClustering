# CryptoClustering

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages over various timeframes.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** The provided dataset is loaded, explored, and normalized using StandardScaler.
- **K-Means Clustering:** The K-Means algorithm is employed to group cryptocurrencies based on their price change patterns.
- **Elbow Curve Analysis:** The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Curve method.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA is utilized to reduce dimensionality and potentially improve clustering results.
- **Visualization:** Scatter plots are generated to visualize and compare the clustering outcomes with and without PCA optimization.
